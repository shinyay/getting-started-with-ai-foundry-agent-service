set location "eastus"

# リソースグループの作成
az group create --name $resourceGroupName --location $location

# 作成されたリソースグループの確認
az group show --name $resourceGroupName --output table
```

### Step 4: Create an Azure AI Foundry Account

Create an Azure AI Foundry account to start using the service.

```shell
set aiAccountName "ai-foundry-account-demo"

# Azure AI Foundryアカウントの作成（AIServices kind を使用）
az cognitiveservices account create \
    --name $aiAccountName \
    --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
    --location $location \
    --kind "AIServices" \

### Step 5: Create Supporting Resources

#### Create a Storage Account

Create a storage account to store data and models used by the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service.

```shell
# 変数の設定（短縮名 + 日付でユニークな名前を生成）
set storageAccountName "staifoundry"(date +%Y%m%d)

# Storage Accountの作成
az storage account create \
    --name $storageAccountName \
    --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
    --location $location \
    --sku "Standard_LRS" \
    --kind "StorageV2"

# Storage Accountの詳細確認
az storage account show \
    --name $storageAccountName \
    --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
    --output table
```

#### Create Azure Cosmos DB Account

Create an Azure Cosmos DB account to store structured data for the AI Foundry Agent Service.

```shell
# 変数の設定
set cosmosAccountName "cosmos-aifoundry-demo"

# 注意: East USで容量不足の場合は、別のリージョンを試してください
# 代替リージョンの例: westus2, centralus, westeurope
# set alternativeLocation "westus2"

# Option 1: 元のリージョン（eastus）で作成を試行

# az cosmosdb delete \
#     --name $cosmosAccountName \
#     --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
#     --yes

# 削除完了を待ってから再作成
# set alternativeLocation "westus2"
# az cosmosdb create \
#     --name $cosmosAccountName \
#     --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
#     --locations regionName=$alternativeLocation \
#     --default-consistency-level "Session" \
#     --enable-automatic-failover false

# Cosmos DB Accountの確認
az cosmosdb show \
    --name $cosmosAccountName \
    --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
    --output table
```

#### Create Azure AI Search Service

Create Azure AI Search Service to enable search capabilities for your AI Foundry Agent Service.

```shell

```shell
# 現在のユーザーのオブジェクトIDを取得
set currentUser (az ad signed-in-user show --query id --output tsv)
echo "Current User ID: $currentUser"
```

#### Assign Roles

Assign the appropriate roles to the current user for the AI account.

```shell

    --output table
```


### Step 7: Create an AI Agent using Azure AI Foundry Portal

Now that you have set up the required Azure resources, you can create an AI agent using the Azure AI Foundry Portal.

#### Prerequisites for Agent Creation

Before creating an agent, ensure you have the following:

1. **Required Azure Roles**:
   - **Azure AI Developer** role or **Azure AI User** role assigned at the project scope
   - Minimum required permissions: `agents/*/read`, `agents/*/action`, `agents/*/delete`

2. **Azure AI Foundry Project**:
   - An Azure AI Foundry Hub and Project must be created
   - A model (like GPT-4o) should be deployed

#### Step-by-Step Agent Creation Process

**Step 7.1: Access Azure AI Foundry Portal**

1. Navigate to [Azure AI Foundry Portal](https://ai.azure.com)
2. Sign in with your Azure credentials
3. If you're in a project, select "Azure AI Foundry" at the top left to go to the Home page

**Step 7.2: Create a New Project (if not already done)**

1. Click **"Create an agent"** for the fastest experience
2. Enter a name for your project (e.g., "AI-Agent-Demo-Project")
3. If you want to customize default values, select **"Advanced options"**
4. Select **"Create"**
5. Wait for resources to be provisioned:
   - An account and project will be created
   - The GPT-4o model will automatically be deployed
   - A default agent will be created

**Step 7.3: Configure Your AI Agent**

1. Once provisioning is complete, you'll land in the **Agent Playground**
2. In the left sidebar, navigate to **"Build and customize"** → **"Agents"**
3. Select **"+ New agent"** to create a new agent
4. Configure the following components:

   **Basic Configuration:**
   - **Agent Name**: Give your agent a descriptive name (e.g., "Customer Support Agent")
   - **Description**: Add a brief description of what your agent does
   - **Model Selection**: Choose your deployed model (GPT-4o is recommended)

   **System Instructions:**
   Add detailed instructions for your agent. Example:
   ```
   You are a helpful customer support agent for a technology company.
   You can answer questions about products, help with troubleshooting,
   and provide information about services. Always be polite, professional,
   and helpful. If you don't know something, admit it and offer to
   connect the customer with a human specialist.
   ```

   **Advanced Settings:**
   - **Temperature**: Adjust creativity (0.1 for more deterministic, 0.9 for more creative)
   - **Top P**: Control response diversity (0.1 for focused, 1.0 for diverse)

**Step 7.4: Add Tools and Capabilities**

Your agent can be enhanced with various tools:

1. **Code Interpreter**: Enable for data analysis and code execution
2. **Knowledge Sources**: Upload files or connect to Azure AI Search indexes
3. **Custom Functions**: Add Azure Functions for external integrations (via SDK)

**Step 7.5: Test Your Agent**

1. In the **Agent Playground**, start a conversation with your agent
2. Test various scenarios relevant to your use case
3. Verify that the agent responds appropriately to different types of questions
4. Test any uploaded knowledge sources by asking specific questions about the content

**Step 7.6: Deploy and Share**

1. Once satisfied with your agent's performance, you can:
   - Share the playground link with team members
   - Integrate the agent into applications using the Azure AI SDK
   - Export agent configuration for version control

#### Example Agent Scenarios

**Basic Customer Support Agent:**
```
System Instructions: "You are a customer support agent for an e-commerce platform.
Help customers with order inquiries, return policies, and product information.
Always ask for order numbers when relevant and provide clear, step-by-step guidance."
```

**Technical Documentation Assistant:**
```
System Instructions: "You are a technical documentation assistant. Help developers
understand API documentation, provide code examples, and troubleshoot integration issues.
Always reference official documentation and provide working code snippets when possible."
```

**HR Policy Assistant:**
```
System Instructions: "You are an HR assistant helping employees understand company
policies, benefits, and procedures. Provide accurate information from uploaded
policy documents and guide employees to appropriate resources or contacts."
```

#### Next Steps

After creating your basic agent:

1. **Enhance with RAG**: Upload company documents for knowledge grounding
2. **Add Custom Tools**: Integrate with external APIs using Azure Functions
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track agent conversations and improve instructions
4. **Scale Deployment**: Integrate into applications using the Azure AI SDK
